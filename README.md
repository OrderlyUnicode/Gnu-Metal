# Gnu-Metal 
An attempt at making a sort of okay video game inspired by Brutal Doom in 10 days for the Linux Game Jam of 2022 

> It's current year and you, the player, are a former mercenary hired for one last job to investigate mysterious disappearances along the USA/Canada border. The trail leads you to an encampment of cultists who don't take too kindly to your presence.

## Installation
~~Until the fist proper release, you will have to have `godot` installed, open the project file, and export it. Once there's an actual release, simply clone the project and move the files wherever you typically keep loose binary files on your system.~~ There is now an offical release, so you can simply download that and run it. 
## System Requirements

 OS: Windows 10 or a Linux Distro with a 5.X kernel
 
 CPU: Probably anything released in the last ~15 years
 
 GPU: Something with ~256MB of vRAM and OpenGL ES 3.0 support
 
 RAM: Whatever is needed to run the base OS + 128MB
 
 Additional Notes: The will likely also work on Windows 7, Windows 11, or a Linux distro with a recent 4.X kernel, but I cannot offer support for those.
