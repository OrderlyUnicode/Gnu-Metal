# Gnu-Metal 
An attempt at making a sort of okay video game inspired by Brutal Doom in 10 days for the Linux Game Jam of 2022 
## Installation
Until the fist proper release, you will have to have `godot` installed, open the project file, and export it. Once there's an actual release, simply clone the project and move the files wherever you typically keep loose binary files on your system.

Only a relatively modern Linux distro (think something with a 5.X kernel version) or Windows 10 with the dependencies for Godot 3.4.4 is supposrted, as I am not able to test for any other operating systems at this time.
